## Bitwise operators

| Operator         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| bit1 & bit2      | The AND(****&****) operator is used to compare two bits and gives a result equal to 1 if both the bits are 1, and it returns 0, if any one bit is 0.                                 |
| bit1 &#124; bit2 | The OR(****&#124;****) operator is used to compare two bits and gives a result equal to 1 if anyone of the bit is 1 or both the bits are 1, and if both are 0 it returns 0.          |
| bit1 ^ bit2      | The EXCLUSIVE-OR(****^****) also known as XOR(****^****) operator is used to compare two bits and returns 1 if any one of the bit is 1 and it returns 0 if both the bits are 0 or 1. |
| ~bit1            | The COMPLEMENT(****~****) operator is similar to 1's complement and can be used to convert all the 1's to 0's and all the 1' to 0's of the operand.                                  |
