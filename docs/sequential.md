# Digital Sequential Circuits
{: .no_toc }

The combinational circuit does not use any memory. 
Hence the previous state of input does not have any effect on the present state of the circuit. 
But sequential circuit has memory so output can vary based on input. This type of circuits uses previous input, output, clock and a memory element.
