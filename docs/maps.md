## Introduction

To overcome the difficulty of simplifing the Boolean functions , Karnaugh introduced a method for simplification of Boolean functions in an easy way. This method is known as Karnaugh map method or K-map method. It is a graphical method, which consists of 2^n cells for ‘n’ variables. The adjacent cells are differed only in single bit position.
