## Getting started

### Dependencies

Interactive-Book is a digital logic design book built on jekyll, a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

### Quick start

1. clone the git repo
```bash
$ git clone
```

2. Run you local Jekyll server
```bash
$ jekyll serve
```
```bash
# .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
3. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.
